The game is played like this:

1. The game show set has three doors. A prize such as a car or vacation is behind one door, and the other two doors hide a valueless prize called a Zonk; in most discussions of the problem, the Zonk is a goat.
2. The contestant chooses one door. Weâ€™ll assume the contestant has no inside knowledge of which door holds the prize, so the contestant will just make a random choice.
3. The smiling host Monty Hall opens one of the other doors, always choosing one that shows a goat, and always offers the contestant a chance to switch their choice to the remaining unopened door.
4. The contestant either chooses to switch doors, or opts to stick with the first choice.
5. Monty calls for the remaining two doors to open, and the contestant wins whatever is behind their chosen door.
